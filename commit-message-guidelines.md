# Commit message guidelines  

## Unacceptable:   
INITIAL WORK – Does not describe the content of the commit  
PROGRESS – Meaningless and un-needed  
MORE – Same as above  
  
## Acceptable:  
Use imperative language i.e – “If applied, this commit will….(THIS IS THE PART YOU PUT IN YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE)”  
For example:  
ADD LISTENER FOR PORT 21  
FIX TYPO IN ‘POTATOS’  
REPLACE ‘NAMES’ LIST WITH TUPLE  
Or something along these lines! Make sure it describes what the commit contains and use the description if necessary.
