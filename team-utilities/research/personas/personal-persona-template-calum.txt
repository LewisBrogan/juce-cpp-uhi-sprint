Does not have a large portfolio. Has little time to expand his photography interest as it currently doesn't pay.

Age: 22
Gender: Female
Background/Job: Self-employed web designer
Likes: Social media - pintrest, instagram, motorcycling
Dislikes: Complicated technology, adverts
Spending habits: Still lives at home and has a decent salary meaning that she has plenty disposable income which is usually spent on socialising and status symbols.
Pain points: Struggles to find affordable material without having to pay expensive subscriptions. Her clients are mostly small businesses do not want or expect to pay for content! Current content platforms are clunky and complicated due to unintuative ux and further hampered by excessive advertising.
